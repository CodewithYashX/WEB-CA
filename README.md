I have made the website of a smartwatch called orbit. I have described its features and specifications.
I have used h1,h2,h3,h4 for heading, br tag for highlighting the main things and hr tag for seprating the section.
I have upload the image of design of watch using <img src="" alt=""> tags.
I have also made a list of features using ul and li tags and also created a table of specifications using table,tr,th,tb tags.
And at last I have used ancher tag  for giving link for more detail and also used comments for detail.
